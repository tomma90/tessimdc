# tessimdc
A code to simulate a Transition Edge Sensor (TES) response according to:
[Irwin & Hilton, Transition edge sensors, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1007/10933596_3).

We also provide an AC bias version based on the DfMux readout scheme: 
[Dobbs et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4737629).

The code is still being developed. In order to use it import the module tessimdc.py and give a look to test_tes_dc.py or test_tes_ac.py for some example on how to use the code.
